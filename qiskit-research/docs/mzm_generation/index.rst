=============================
Majorana zero mode generation
=============================

This experiment simulates Majorana zero modes on the IBM Quantum hardware.
The results are published at `arXiv:2206.00563`_.
The documentation for this module consists of three notebooks:

1. The `tutorial`_ contains background information and shows how the building blocks
   of the experiment were implemented.
2. The `data collection notebook`_ contains the code used to collect experimental data.
3. The `analysis notebook`_ contains the code used to analyze the data and generate plots.
