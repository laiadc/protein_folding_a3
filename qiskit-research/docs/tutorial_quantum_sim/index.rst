Tutorial on quantum simulation
==============================

This experiment simulates the time evolution under a tight binding model on IBM Quantum hardware.
The results are published on the arXiv `arXiv:2209.02795`_.
The documentation for this module consists of one notebook that contains background information, shows how the building blocks of the experiment were implemented, collects experimental data, analyzes data, and generates plots.
